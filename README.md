This is pretty much what my 2nd year netcentric systems project was. I tried to keep it simple, well at least enough to try and avoid problems. To see it, just clone the repo and once you have done that, from the root directory, just double click index.html. 
This will give a general idea of what this was supposed to look like, because the server it was being ran on is now down, you might not be able to see metadata, only mock data, but you will be able to see generally what it was supposed to look like.
I am quite proud of this project as I felt like a fish out of water in that I wasn't too famliar with any of these concepts at the time. I am now knowledgable and proud.
I am keen to learn more, If you do have any pointers for me, please do not hesitate to contact me via email on mbofho47@gmail.com.
Thank you for taking your time and viewing my first baby.
